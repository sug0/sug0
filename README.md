### Hi

I'm Tiago. ðŸ¤™

My main interests right now are image processing, distributed systems, security and networking.
Currently, I'm working on my master's thesis, on the implementation of a Byzantine fault tolerant
state machine replication library in Rust, which I am very excited about.

If you feel like we should talk about common interests or any business proposal,
you can reach me by email here:

Enjoy your stay!
